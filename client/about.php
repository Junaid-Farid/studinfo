			 <h4>Old Campus IUB</h4>
				<p>This is the Picure of old Campus Islamia University Bahawalpur. </p>
				<p>Beautiful environment as you can see here in Picture.</p>
				<p>In view of the changing scenario, Jamia Abbasia was declared as a chartered University in the year 1975, and renamed as The Islamia University of Bahawalpur. Initially, it started functioning at Abbasia and Khawaja Fareed Campuses with ten Departments. In order to construct a modern and self-contained campus, 1250 acres of sandy land was acquired by the University on Hasilpur Road about eight kilometers away from the city center.</p>
				<p>Over a period of time with continuous efforts and hard work, the sand dunes have been converted into well-built faculties, green lawns, hostels, residential colony, farms and orchards. It is known as Baghdad-ul-Jadeed Campus. Currently, there are 60 Department offering 127 programs.</p>

								<p>Following is the picture of the main audotorium in Islamia University Bahawalpur Baghdad-ul-Jadid Campus.</p>
								<p>His Excellency Mamnoon Hussain, President Islamic Republic of Pakistan has said that it is the great beneficence of Allah the Almighty that we have been blessed with plains, mountains, all four season with full bloom and people are unparalleled in their ownself. Hence, I can very rightly proclaim that our highly educated youth is the hope of motherland&rsquo;s future and their self determination can change the fate of the country. Your knowledge, your dedication, your struggle and your determination is like a ray of hope for the nation who has pinned expectations on you, because you are the bright future of Pakiatan. He expressed these views on the occasion of IUB Convocation 2014, which was held in Main Auditorium, Baghdad-ul-Jadeed Campus Islamia University of Bahawalpur.</p>
